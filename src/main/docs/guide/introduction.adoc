Grails Profiles encapsulate project commands, templates, and plugins.
To create an application using the `rest-api` profile you can use the next command:

[source, bash]
----
grails create-app myapp --profile=rest-api
----

You can also choose this project when generating your project from the http://start.grails.org[Grails Application Forge], either from the web app or via the API:

[source, bash]
----
curl -O start.grails.org/myapp.zip -d profile=rest-api
----

Grails Application Forge is a great way to discover the different provided features in the profile.
